## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about making responsive designs, I used a lot of relative units for my webpage, like em and rem and I learned to make an analysis of the design in order to make the transition to bigger displays much more easy.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about making responsive designs and to center better the content for other displays

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&t=4301s) - This helped me to understand the basics of responsive designs and how flexbox actually works
